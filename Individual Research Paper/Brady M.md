# Robotics and Artificial Intelligence

Robotics is the intelligent connection of perception to action. This defers to computer systems that are programmed to connect perception to action. Computer systems formed in this manner, simply are not feasible for robotics. This is simply because people, which robotics are designed to replace or assist, are not born with the capacity to learn or be aware of its surroundings. Hard coded systems can not reason, they can not learn about new objects in their surrounding, they are simply too rigid for complex work.

## why do we need them?

This is all very certain unintelligent robots are able to repetitive, menial tasks very well and efficiently. Packaging, welding, painting, parts manufacturing, robots have been doing these tasks with ease for quite some time now.

## the knowledge needed for AI

In areas such as medicine, aviation and construction, expert opinions and knowledge need to be clearly described. Various situations and problems faced by them need to be clearly outlined (this has often proved difficult).

The physical world needs to be modeled by AI systems in a way that it can deal with real world problems. These geometric models are often formulated by Computer-aided design. Connecting perception to action is then possible by giving these AI systems perception of these geometric models by giving these models a sense for force (how much force to apply to an object, and how much force to expect from a machine or phenomena). These systems also need to recognise and represent uncertainty in some fashion, so it can apply its knowledge to overcome it.
