### The Measure of a Man

This episode touched on the themes of intellectual property and slavery. Member of the Starfleet Enterprise, Data, an intelligent Android was put on trial for whether or not he is considered the property of the Starfleet. This trial was prompted by Data, and his Captain Picard, when he refused to be taken for inspection by the Starfleet robotics engineer, Commander Maddox. Maddox, along with the engineer of the Enterprise Commander Rikker, makes the case that Data is a machine that can be easily disassembled and switched off without any permanent harm. Data, showing personifying characteristics of disappointment, intelligence (poker game), emotion (longing for ) and sadness (on learning he might depart the Enterprise), makes a case for himself with the help of his Captain Picard. Picard highlights some of those emotions expressed by Data, using proof by contradiction at times to affirm that Data is in fact sentient.
Data and Picard thus won the trial with their arguments, essentially making any claim of intellectual property the Starfleet may have over Data, moot. It also highlights the boundaries on what can be considered the (intellectual) property of an entity.
